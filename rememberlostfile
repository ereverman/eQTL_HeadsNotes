# recapitulating what i remember from the last bit of code I wrote for midgut analysis:

# Start with final.data.tpm and mapp_matrix_effect files and InteractionFull_significant/InteractionFull_results

# three types of comparisons for the change in gene expression between the resistant and sensitive lines under each treatment condition and within each group under each treatment condition.

1. transform the final.data.tpm file and reassign the gene names as column headers
2. copy the sample information from mapp_effect_matrix
3. convert the wide file to long format and then remove unnecessary files to save memory
4.
